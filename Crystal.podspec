                        Crystal is a lightweight and intuitive theme manager for iOS. It takes advantage of Swiftâ€™s features to provide an easy-to-use interface. With Crystal, you can integrate themes into your app with confidence and flexibility.

                        - **Flexible**: Crystal is compitible with any object, not just built-in UI components. You can use Crystal anywhere.
                        - **Friendly**: Apply themes in a way you're familiar with, and no additional property APIs will make you confused and distracted.
                        - **Simple**: Adding a theme is as simple as creating an instance. It's easy to maintain your themes with Crystal.
                        - **Type Safe**: Take full advantage of swift's type safety. Apply your theme with confidence and benefit from compile-time check.
